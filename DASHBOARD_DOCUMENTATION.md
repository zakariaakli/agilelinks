## Detailed Functionality Documentation

### 1. Gamification System

**Purpose**: Motivate users through achievement tracking, XP progression, and visual rewards.

**Key Features**:
- **Level Calculation**: Users advance levels based on total XP from activities
- **XP Sources**:
  - Completed milestones: 100 XP each
  - Nudge responses: 25 XP each
  - Nudge streaks: 10 XP per day
  - Created plans: 200 XP each
  - Daily activity: 5 XP per day
- **Achievement System**: 6 distinct achievements with progress tracking
- **Progress Stats Grid**: Visual display of key metrics

**XP Formula**: `(completedMilestones * 100) + (nudgeResponses * 25) + (nudgeStreak * 10) + (totalPlans * 200) + (daysActive * 5)`

**Level Formula**: `Math.floor(totalXP / 500) + 1` (Level up every 500 XP)

**Achievements Available**:
1. **Goal Setter** - Create first plan (1 plan required)
2. **Milestone Master** - Complete 5 milestones 
3. **Consistency King** - Maintain 7-day nudge streak
